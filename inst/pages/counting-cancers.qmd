## Cancer experiences: a personal view

In 60 years of life I have been cancer-free, but many
family members and friends have had to address
the disease.

I prepared a table with some information on contacts
whose cancer experiences I know of:

```{r lktab}
datatable(vjc_cancer_net)
```

Note that the table can be sorted and searched.  You can also
alter the number of records presented.

## Questions

A.1.1. Why would a person make a table like this?

A.1.2. How could this table be made more informative?

## Cancer rates for public health assessment

Motivations for studying cancer at the *population level* are detailed
on a [National Cancer Institute web page.](https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/public-health)

Briefly, cancers contribute to

- years of life lost
- loss of quality of life for patients and families
- lost productivity

Furthermore, as the population ages, the effects of cancer will be more pronounced as time goes on.


*Although cancer affects individual patients and their families in different ways, studying 
its impact on large populations can provide important information that influences 
practices, policies, and programs that directly affect the health of millions of people in 
the United States each year.* -- from the NCI web page

This idea of "studying [cancer's] impact on large populations" brings us immediately to data
science and statistics.

Two terms of epidemiology will be of use to us

- *prevalence*: the proportion of the population currently affected by a disease
- *incidence*: the proportion of the population, in a given time interval, that
was disease-free prior to the interval but developed the disease within the interval

Prevalence expresses the current burden of disease within a population.

Incidence expresses the rapidity with which a disease grows in a population.

For a more detailed discussion of these terms, check [this CDC site](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html#:~:text=Incidence%20refers%20to%20the%20occurrence,cases%20per%20unit%20of%20population.).

An excellent resource on rate estimation and interpretation is the [online book on
cancer screening](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK550212/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK550212.pdf) by Pamela Marcus, hosted at NCI.


### Collecting cancer data

The role of statistics in our lives has
intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Policymakers have proposed that personal protective
behaviors and legal obligations to mask
or avoid traveling can change depending on the
"infection rates" in localities.

Cancer Registries are systems managed at the
state level that collect information on cancers
as they are identified by health care providers.

"SEER" stands for Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results.
It is a program developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Data are collected at 17 regional centers.

The SEER web site, offers various facets of cancer data to investigate.

## County-level variation in cancer rates

We focus on colorectal cancer:

![NIH/CDC State Cancer Profiles](images/colon8GroupIncidence.jpg)

## Exercises

A.3.1  Use [State Cancer Profiles](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/map/map.noimage.php) to produce
a map of colorectal cancer incidence for Massachusetts.  You will have to
make selections in the web interface.  Choose the Quantiles interval type with 8 intervals.
Obtain the map for both sexes, all ages.  What is the county with lowest incidence of colorectal cancer?

A.3.2 True or false: In Massachusetts, the age-adjusted incidence of colorectal cancer for individuals
greater than 65 years of age is approximately ten times that of individuals less than 50 years of age.

A.3.3 Return to cancers of colon and rectum.  Form a map for Area "United States", Area Type "By State".
Limit to age less than 50.  Which state has the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in this age group?

## Visualizing variability

We have been looking at cancer incidence data in the form of tables of numbers.
We can sort, search, filter these tables fairly easily.  "Data graphics", also
known as "statistical visualization", have been devised to help us get
insights that have a different character.  One objective is to develop a
sense of variation in a quantity of interest, by aggregating data values in
various ways and presenting these aggregates in graphical form.



### Histograms
 
Histograms help visualize variability in a quantity of interest.  The range of the quantity
of interest is "binned" -- chopped up into intervals of equal width.  Midpoints of
bins are plotted on the x axis, and counts of values in bins are plotted on the y axis.

We illustrate with the CDC WONDER data on Prostate cancer incidence.

```{r lkhist, echo=TRUE}
make_hist(site="Prostate", binwidth=5, rate_table=littab)
```

We can change the visual character of the histogram display by reducing the bin width.


```{r lkhist2, echo=TRUE}
make_hist(site="Prostate", binwidth=2, rate_table=littab)
```

#### Exercises

A.5.1 Based on the first histogram shown above, what is the most commonly
observed value for prostate cancer incidence (per 100,000 men) in metropolitan
statistical areas (MSAs) of the United States?  You can scroll over the display
to find values for particular MSAs.  Your answer can be a range of numbers.

A.5.2 Use the first histogram to report on the number of MSAs that report
prostate cancer incidence between 142 and 147 per 100,000 men.

A.5.3 The second histogram is produced from the same set of statistics as the
first, but uses a smaller "binwidth".  Comment on some differences between
the two displays.

A.5.4 Add a cell to your notebook using the "+" button, enter the command
`make_hist(site="Female Breast")` and press the "play" button.  What
is the most commonly reported rate of female breast cancer incidence in
MSAs in the US?

A.5.5 Hover over the leftmost block in the display.  What is the MSA with
lowest value of Female Breast cancer incidence, and what is the reported rate?

### Using a histogram to compare cancer incidence rates in two areas

By computing differences or ratios and forming the histogram, we
can assess whether there is a tendency to higher values in
one of the areas of interest.

```{r lk2, echo=TRUE}
ggplotly(make_comparison(rate_table=littab, type="ratios"))
```

More detail about individual
values can be obtained with an approach called "beeswarm" plotting.

```{r lk3, echo=TRUE}
ggplotly(make_pair(type="beeswarm", rate_table=littab ))
```

#### Exercises

A.5.6 The use of ratios in the `make_comparison` display above eliminates
information about the absolute incidence rates.  Open a notebook cell and
use the commands
```
library(YESCDS)
library(plotly)
data(woncan)
ggplotly(make_comparison(rate_table=woncan, type="scatter"))
```
When you hover the mouse over points on the display, the
individual rates are presented.

True or False: the presence of a majority of points below and to the right of the
straight line implies that the incidence rates for a variety of
cancer types in Baton Rouge, LA are
more frequently higher than those in Tucson, AZ.

A.5.7 Using the values presented in the
interactive scatterplot, compute the ratio of 
incidence rates for prostate cancer in Baton Rouge
compared to those in Tucson.  Compare to the result
provided in the `make_comparison` histogram above.

## Age adjustment for fair comparisons

Two basic types of comparison are of interest in cancer epidemiology:

- Do cancer rates differ between geographic regions (counties, states, countries, ...)?
- Do cancer rates change over time?

Because cancer risks increaase generally as people age, comparisons
of cancer risk should account for the "age structure" in the
regions or time periods being compared.

## Crude rate examples

Crude rates ignore age structure.  Here are some examples of mortality rates taken (with rounding)
from a Statistics Canada web site.

```{r examine}
canada_crude[6,4] = NA
canada_crude
```

Question: What is the (rounded) crude mortality rate for the older age group in 2011?

## Age structure

The "age structure" of a population is the percentage of population
reporting ages in different groups.  Usually the grouping is
finer than what we are using in this example; more realistic
illustrations are given below.

Statistics Canada proposed using the age structure of Canada in 1991
as a reference for standardization.  In 1991, 62% of Canadians
were age 0 to 39y, and 38% were 40y and older.

We use these percentages to adjust the crude rates.

## Adjusted rate computation

For the year 2000, we take the crude rates of 7 and 450 (per 100000
population) and reweight and sum:
```
7 * .62 + 450 * .38
```
yielding 175.3 per 100000 "standard population".  This is the
age standardized mortality rate in the year 2000.

### Questions

A.6.1 What is the age standardized mortality rate for 2011?

A.6.2 What can you say about the cancer mortality trend in Canada between 2000 and 2011?

### Answers

```
A.6.1

A.6.2
```

## Some examples of age structure models

A [methods paper](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer/fayfeuerconfidenceintervals.pdf) on
confidence intervals for standardized rates includes the following display:

![Age structure](images/standardPopGraphs.jpg)

We read this as showing that in the US in 1970, about 18% of the population
was under 10 years of age, while in the world overall, about 22% of the
population was under 10 years of age.

### Question

A.6.3 What features of the bottom two displays above suggest that
it will be important to differentiate age distributions for men and
women in forming standardized rates?
